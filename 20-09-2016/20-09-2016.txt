1.Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have been removed (not case sensitive). You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only non-overlapping instances, so with "zzz" removing "zz" leaves "z".
a.withoutString("Hello there", "llo") ? "He there"
b.withoutString("Hello there", "e") ? "Hllo thr"
c.withoutString("Hello there", "x") ? "Hello there"

2.Given three integers, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.
a.evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) ? true
b.evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) ? true
c.evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) ? false

3.Given two strings, word and a separator sep, return a big string made of count occurrences of the word, separated by the separator string sep.
a.repeatSeparator("Word", "X", 3) ? "WordXWordXWord"
b.repeatSeparator("This", "And", 2) ? "ThisAndThis"
c.repeatSeparator("This", "And", 1) ? "This"
d.repeatSeparator(“99”, “,”, 3) ? “99,99,99”
